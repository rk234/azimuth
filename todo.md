- [ ] Implement multi pane switching
- [ ] Asynchronous loading of radar layers, status bar
- [ ] Async automatic data polling
- [ ] Radar looping, handle changing number of frames on the fly, async loading too
- [ ] Figure out cities and road rendering
  - [ ] Look into [R-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree)
  - [ ] Implement line string for geojson layer
